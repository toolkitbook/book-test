Release Notes
=============

The full list of Release Notes can be seen [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/public_releases/RN_index.html) and the latest Release Notes [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/public_releases/release_notes.html).

> These notes give a somewhat superficial and incomplete (albeit still useful) description of the latest NCBI C++ Toolkit changes, fixes and additions. Some important topics (especially numerous bug fixes and feature improvements, but possibly a bigger fish) are just out of scope of these notes. Feel free to write to the mailing group <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mailman/listinfo/cpp> with any questions or reports.
